  I am Brody Hart, enjoyer of literature and computers, and I
created this game, it is still in progress, but I have a pretty
good vision for it.
    
I created this game with the vision of 1984 by George
Orwell, and Papers, Please; a video game created to
actually mimic the authoritarian government and harsh
characteristics found in stories like 1984. 1984 was written by
George Orwell, a sort of 'political writer' who wrote stories that
pictured authoritarian and rich-ruled countries in his works like
Animal Farm and 1984. On the contrary, Papers, Please is a
video game that takes place in the fictional war-ridden
country of Arstotzka, ruled by big brother-esque authority. In
the game, you are working for the Ministry of Admission via
work lottery, denying and accepting passports all day. I
created this game and decided to call it 'God Bless America'
due to the use of the common phrase, and the similarity to
'Glory to Arstotzka' from Papers, Please, and even uses 'God'
as a big brother figure, because the idea of a figure ALWAYS
watching is scary and entertaining...
    
  Anyways, I like it, and if you dont, screw you...
Thank you for reading!!!
